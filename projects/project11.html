                <h4>Project Description</h4>
                <p>Fly Don't is a very simple and an old Indian childhood game. The basic concept is that you have to identify the property of the object coming on the screen, whether it flies or it doesn’t .Some objects like pigeon, sparrow, kite, balloon etc fly, while others like dog, cat, lion, TV, comb doesn’t fly.

There will be object and characters coming and going on the game screen, you have to identify the object property and then press the “Fly” or “Don’t Fly” button accordingly. Correct guess will give you points; incorrect guess will give 0 points. In each level, you must identify at least 15 out of 20 images correctly, in order to go to the next level.

Game has two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard. In Easy Level, the game play will be normal and the buttons will be fixed, while in Hard Level, there will be slight change in the way buttons come in game, sometimes fly button will be in left, sometimes it will be in right. So you have to concentrate more during the game in hard level.
